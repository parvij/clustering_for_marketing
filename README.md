# clustering_for_marketing
This project was about clustering on players of a mobile app game. It has more than 1 million players. 
First, I've explored the data and explained it to the marketing team (Data_Understanding). Second,  I've prepared the data and ran a GaussianMixture for clustering and then with the marketing team, we've tried different features for clustering and selected the best choice to interact with the player differently (sgm GaussianMixture).
